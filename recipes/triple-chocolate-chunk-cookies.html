        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cookies are no ordinary cookies, they contain three different chocolate flavors. 
        They can be made large or small. They are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside
        It is reccomended to refridgerate the batter for 48 hours before baking, which allows the 
        dough to fully form its flavor. The time it'll take to prep is 15 minutes, cooking time is 10 minutes.</p>

       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>
               Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and 
               salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer 
               until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. Add egg 
               and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes 
               smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. 
                Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but
                some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark 
                chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the
                mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, 
                or up to 48 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 
                10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; thecenters will not look fully done. 
                Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
